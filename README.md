## Launching Dato's (https://dato.com/) ipython notebook in any folder
I wrote a batch script for launching ipython notebook in a directory a user want. I hope this helps for other users.
(This only works for Windows)

1. copy and paste the following to `<your file name>.bat`.

    cd <path to your directory>
    "C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Dato\Dato Launcher\Scripts\ipython.exe" notebook

2. double click the bat file
